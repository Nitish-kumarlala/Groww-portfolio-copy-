            <p>The major components of an investment portfolio are described below –</p>

                    <th>Components</th>
                    <th>Description</th>

                    <td>1.</td>
                    <td>Stocks</td>
                    <td>Stocks refer to company shares and the investors’ ownership of the same. Notably, the percentage
                        of ownership depends on the number of company stocks held by an individual. The stockholders are
                        entitled to a share of the company’s profits, and they avail it in the form of dividends.
                        Investors can further generate higher returns on their investment in stock by selling the same
                        at a higher price. Stocks are considered to be the reward generating component of an investment
                        portfolio. However, they come with a significant risk factor.</td>

                    <td>2.</td>
                    <td>Bonds</td>
                    <td>Bonds come with a maturity date and are considered less risky than stocks. On maturity,
                        investors receive the principal investment amount along with interest. Bonds constitute the
                        risk-cushioning aspect of an investment portfolio.</td>

            <h1>Types of portfolio</h1>
            <p>Though there are several types of investment portfolios, investors make it a point to build one that
                matches their investment intent and risk capacity.</p>
            <p>Based on investment strategies, these following are some common types of portfolios –</p>
            <h2>1. Income portfolio</h2>
            <p>This type of portfolio emphasises more on securing a steady flow of income from investment avenues. In
                other words, it is not entirely focused on potential capital appreciation.</p>
            <p>For instance, income-driven investors may invest in stocks that generate regular dividends instead of
                those who show a track of price appreciation.</p>
            <h2>Growth</h2>
            <p>A growth-oriented portfolio mostly parks money into <a href="https://groww.in/p/growth-stocks">growth
                    stocks</a> of a company who are in their active growth stage. Typically, growth portfolios are
                subject to greater risks. This type of portfolio is known for presenting high risk and reward aspects.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Value Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Such a portfolio puts money into cheap assets in valuation and focuses on securing bargains in the
                investment market. When the economy is struggling, and companies are barely surviving, value-oriented
                investors look for profitable companies whose shares are priced lower than their fair value. When the
                market revives, value portfolio holders generate substantial earnings.</p>
            <p>Investors must note that several factors tend to influence how one decides to build a portfolio.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Factors that Affect Portfolio Allocation</h1>
            <p>These following factors tend to influence an investor’s portfolio allocation to a great extent –</p>
            <h2>Risk Tolerance</h2>
            <p>Investors’ risk appetite impacts how they are going to allocate their financial assets and investments
                into their portfolio. One can quickly gauge the risk tolerance level of an investor from the component
                of their portfolio.</p>
            <p>For instance, conservative investors are often more inclined to build a portfolio that comprises
                large-cap value stock, investment-grade bonds, cash equivalents, market index funds, etc. Conversely,
                individuals with a high-risk appetite may include investments like small-cap and large-cap growth stock,
                high-yield bonds, gold, oil, real estate, etc. in their portfolio.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Time horizon</h2>
            <p>The time-frame of putting money on a particular investment option is also quite crucial for building a
                profitable portfolio. As the general rule suggests, investors should modify their portfolio to achieve a
                conservative asset allocation mix as they approach nearer to their financial goals. It is followed to
                prevent accumulated earnings of their investment portfolio from eroding.</p>
            <p>Typically, investors who are nearing their retirement are recommended to invest a more significant
                portion of their portfolio in less risky assets like – cash and bonds and the remainder in
                higher-yielding options. On the other hand, those who have just begun their career are suggested to
                invest the larger portion of their portfolio into high risk-reward investment options for the long haul.
                A longer time frame will help them to ride out the short-term market fluctuations and losses.</p>
            <p>Other than this, investors’ financial goal is another important factor that influences the portfolio
                allocation. To elaborate, those with long-term goals are more likely to invest in long-term investment
                options like – equity funds, ULIPS, stocks, debt mutual funds. Alternatively, those with short-term
                goals tend to prefer liquid mutual funds, recurring deposits, government bonds, treasury bills and more.
